# Bank Marketing Case – Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

This project addresses a real-world case from a major bank aiming to improve the efficiency of its marketing campaigns. The goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic, financial, and campaign interaction data.

## How to train the model


### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train a model
Run one of the following commands from the project root:
```bash
python src/main.py --model logreg
```
or
```bash
python src/main.py --model xgb
```

This will:

Preprocess and engineer features

Perform hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)

Train and evaluate the model using AUC-PR

Log metrics and artifacts using MLflow

Save the best pipeline for deployment

### 3. View MLflow Results
To start the MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```
Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to explore runs, metrics, and artifacts.

## How to Run the API

Once you've trained and saved the model (via `main.py`), you can serve it through a REST API using **FastAPI**.
> **Note:** If you're using MLflow to load the model (`mlflow.sklearn.load_model(...)`),  
> make sure to **adjust the path or run ID** in `api.py` to match your local MLflow setup.
>  
> You can find the path in your `mlruns/` directory or copy the run ID from the MLflow UI.


### 1. Start the API Server

```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```
This will start a local server at:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 2. Interactive Swagger Docs
Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
You’ll find an interactive UI to test the /predict endpoint.

### 3. Sample Request Payload
```bash
{
  "age": 35,
  "occupation": "technician",
  "marital_status": "married",
  "education": "university.degree",
  "has_credit": "no",

}
```
### 4. Sample Response

## Notebooks Overview

The `notebooks/` directory contains the step-by-step exploratory and modeling workflow used to analyze the data, build the models, and evaluate performance.

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` | Exploratory analysis to uncover patterns, class imbalance, feature distributions, and early behavioral insights |
| `02_preprocessing & feature engineering.ipynb` | Prototyping and testing feature transformations and engineered variables before moving to pipeline code |
| `03_baseline_model_LR.ipynb` | Logistic Regression baseline model, focusing on interpretability and precision |
| `04_XGBoost_model.ipynb` | XGBoost training and tuning, with evaluation focused on recall and AUC-PR for the minority class |
| `05_model_and_feature_analysis.ipynb` | Comparative model evaluation, feature importance inspection, and SHAP analysis for interpretability |

These notebooks document the full lifecycle of the ML solution before moving to production-ready scripts and APIs.
